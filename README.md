# Nestjs app with postgres and sqlite db with all migrations setup.

- postgres: to contain the app logic data.
- sqlite: to contain small, fast retrieved data like (tokens, sessions, ... ).

* they are both with the same ORM

# future work: - include redis (in-memory-db) and mongodb (unstructured db, spatial data, ... ) with different ORMs
